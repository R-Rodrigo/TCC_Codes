# TCC_Codes
This repository was created to store the source code used during the course of my Course Completion Work (TCC).

The codes contained in this repository were used for validation and testing of the modules used in the design and construction of the IoT teaching-learning didactic kit, which I developed as a Completion Work in the Computer Engineering course.

The modules compatible with the created kit are as follows:

1 - 8266 WiFi Module ESP-07 with Adapter
2 - Ublox Neo-6m Gy-gps6mv2 GPS Module with Ceramic Antenna
3 - HC06 Bluetooth Module
4 - GSM GPRS SIM800L Module with Antenna
5 - RFID Reader Module Mfrc522 Mifare
6 - ESP32 WiFi Module
7 - 8266 WiFi Module ESP-01 with Adapter

The codes for each module have been divided into folders to make them more organized.
